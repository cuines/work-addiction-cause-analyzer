# Work Addiction Cause Analyzer

A tool to code and categorize qualitative excerpts about the causes of work addiction, focusing on financial pressure, family dynamics, fear of authority, and lack of personal affection.

## Purpose

This project aims to develop a Python-based qualitative analysis tool that helps researchers identify and categorize underlying causes of work addiction from interview transcripts, surveys, or other textual data.

## Features (Planned)

- Load and parse interview excerpts from text files
- Keyword-based coding of excerpts using predefined cause categories
- Generate summary reports showing frequency of each cause
- Extensible architecture for adding more sophisticated analysis (e.g., NLP)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Run `src/main.py` to see the current functionality.

## Data Format

Sample excerpts are stored in `data/sample_excerpts.txt`. Each line or paragraph represents a separate excerpt.

## Contributing

This is an open research tool. Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
