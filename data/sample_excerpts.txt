I have to work extra hours because my mortgage payments are due next week and I'm behind.

My boss constantly threatens to fire anyone who doesn't meet the aggressive deadlines.

I feel lonely at home, so I stay late at the office to avoid the empty house.

The pressure to provide for my family forces me to take on multiple jobs.

I'm afraid of disappointing my manager, so I never say no to extra assignments.

There's no one waiting for me at home, so working late gives me a sense of purpose.

Bills keep piling up, and I have no choice but to work weekends.

My children need new school supplies, but my salary isn't enough.

The fear of being replaced by a younger colleague drives me to work incessantly.

I stay at work because I don't have any close relationships outside of it.
